# LZW Algorithm - Notes
Let's put this into a separate repository and publish it on npm!

You're mere hours away from being an open source software developer.

## Thoughts
* How can we generalize the current implementation? How can we make it encode an arbitrary alphabet, instead of just `[A-Z]`?
* What parts of the algorithm deserve their own functionality? We talk about having "classes" (misnomer since `js` doens't have classes yet) that do one thing well. What are areas of the code that could be pieced out into their own object.
